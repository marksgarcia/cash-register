# Cash Register Application

## Summary
My toddler was obsessed with playing "Target" so I decided to make him a cash reigster that would allow him to pick items, add them to his cart, and then pay for them. The app was created using __PugJS__, __ES6__, __Sass__, __Font Awesome__, 
## Demo
Here is a [demo](http://jacks-cash-register.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com) of the functioning cash register.

## Additional Information
Future updates for the cash register will be to use a modern Javascript framework like Vue (3.0) and to make it fully-mobile responsive.
